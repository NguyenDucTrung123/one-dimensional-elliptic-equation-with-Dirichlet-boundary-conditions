# one-dimensional-elliptic-equation-with-Dirichlet-boundary-conditions
Consider a one-dimensional elliptic equation:
- (pu')' + qu = f, u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0 (2.1-2.2)
where: p,q,f,p' are square-integral functions
       C0 < p(x) < C1, 0 <= q(x) < C2 for all x in [a,b]
       C0,C1,C2 are positive constants.
classical solution: u in H(^2)(a,b)
weak solution: u in $H_{0}^{1}$
